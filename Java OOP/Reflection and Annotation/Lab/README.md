# Lab: **Reflection and Annotations**

This document defines the **lab** for the ["Java Advanced" course @
Software University](https://softuni.bg/modules/59/java-advanced).
Please submit your solutions (source code) to all below-described
problems in
[Judge](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1604/Reflection-Lab).

# Part I: Reflection

## Reflection

Import "**Reflection.java**" to your "**src**" folder in your project.
Try to use **reflection** and print some information about this class.
Print everything on a new line:

  - **This class type**

  - **Super class type**

  - **All interfaces** that are implemented by this class

  - **Instantiate object** using reflection and print it too

**Donâ€™t change anything in "Reflection class"\!**

### Solution

## Getters and Setters

Use reflection to get all **Reflection** methods. Then prepare an
algorithm that will recognize, which methods are **getters** and
**setters**. Sort each collection **alphabetically** by methods names.
Print to console each **getter** on a new line in the format:

  - "{name} will return class {Return Type}"

Then print all **setters** in the format:

  - "{name} and will set field of class {Parameter Type}"

**Do this without changing anything in** "**Reflection.java**"

## High Quality Mistakes

You are already an expert on **High-Quality Code**, so you know what
kind of **access modifiers** must be set for members of the class. The
time for **revenge** has come. Now you have to check the code produced
by your "**Beautiful and Smart**" trainers in class **Reflection**.
Check all **fields and methods access modifiers**. Sort each category of
members **alphabetically**. Print on the console all **mistakes** in the
format:

  - For Fields:

> "**{fieldName} must be private\!**"

  - For Getters:

> **"**{methodName} have to be public\!**"**

  - For Setters:

> **"**{methodName} have to be private\!**"**

# Part II: Annotations

## Create Annotation

Create annotation **Subject** with a **String\[\]** element called
**categories**, that:

  - Should be available at runtime

  - Can be placed only on types

###  Examples

## Coding Tracker

Create annotation **Author** with a **String** element called **name**,
that:

  - Should be available at runtime

  - Can be placed only on methods

Create a class **Tracker** with a method:

  - public static void printMethodsByAuthor()
